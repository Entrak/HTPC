# HTPC launchpage
Code I use for my HTPC: HTML, CSS

This is a simple, yet effective startpage for my HTPC.
It contains a meteogram for my area and clickable image-links to the streaming services I utilize.
Easy to customize to your own needs through editing the source-code.

To get the meteogram fram YR.no: 
  1) Go to yr.no and search for your desired location.
  2) On the page for your location, select "hour by hour" in the left hand menu to get the meteogram.
  3) Open up the source code of the page and search for "meteogram.png" and retrieve the link to the meteogram.
  3.1) If you want the advanced meteogram option, select "detailed", then open the source and search for "avansert_meteogram.png".
  4) Replace URL in start.html with the URL retrieved from source.
 
 Logos are retrieved from the websites of the desired streaming services.

HTPC setup:
  1) Add all files into a desired folder.
  2) Add start.html as the default startpage for your HTPC's webbrowser.
